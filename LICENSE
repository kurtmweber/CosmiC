Realistically, I highly doubt that this is the sort of thing that anyone involved
in any of the activities described above (or anyone else, for that matter) would
find any use for.  Nevertheless, I have some serious concerns about the naive
understanding of "freedom" that seems to underpin most of the "free software"
discussion, which seems to me unconcerned with whether or not supposedly "free"
usage of software actually contributes to or works against a broader project of
creating a freer, more open and welcoming society for everyone.  More than
anything else, this is my statement against that.
